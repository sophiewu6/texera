Indonesia ferry fire and fatal train crash in Java
A fire on a crowded Indonesian ferry and a collision between two passenger trains, have left at least 14 people dead and scores injured. The accidents happened just 30 minutes apart on the main island of Java.The ferry fire broke out soon after the vessel left Merak port. More then 400 people were brought to safety but 11 are known to have died.At least three people were killed when a passenger train was hit head-on by another while trying to change lanes.Dozens of injured people were taken to hospital. An investigation is under way into the train crash in Banjar, a village in West Java province, a spokesman for the Transportation Ministry told the Associated Press.At the port in Merak, Indonesian television showed firefighters on rescue ships near the ferry trying to extinguish the blaze with huge water cannons.Panicked survivors were shown jumping off the ship wearing lifejackets.A vehicle on the ferry was believed to be the cause of the fire, which started at about 0300 local time (2000 GMT Thursday).One lorry driver, Musaka, told Agence France-Presse: "It was very scary when the fire started as it was still very dark. A passenger bus in the vehicle area caught fire first and my truck also burned."I was able to save myself as I could grab a lifejacket. I quickly jumped off into the sea."Ferries are a main source of transportation given Indonesia's thousands of islands, and accidents are common due to overcrowding and poor safety standards.
